# huddoc

huddoc is a chrome extension that allows you to superimpose information over your website. It's intended to show additional contextual information to an organization's internal staff to aid in routing site issues and generally understanding how a website is composed.

## Goals / Features

- Implement a contextual overlay that can highlight elements on the page (via outline or similar) and provide an information popup.
- Implement a DSL for describing conditions to show messaging, and what messaging to show.
- Allow rulesets for the extension to be loaded from external sources.
